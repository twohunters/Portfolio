# Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio. It isn't much at the moment, but it's mine, and it's the foundation of an ever-changing workspace that I'll continue to build upon for years to come. Currently there are four web applications featured that I have either built myself or with others as a group, more will be added in time.
